# MyClone
## About:

  This was the first larger project I've written in c++ OpenGL using SFML and glm.
  
  It's a basic MineCraft clone, having implemented:
      
      Full menus with multiple world's being able to be saved
      infinit terrain using perlin noise
      multiple biomes
      threaded chunkLoading
      loading and saving of rendered chunks
      terrain collision detection
      lighting calculations per block (disabled because of unfindable bug in light updates)
      full player invenory
      crafting (2x2, 3x3)
      easy to add blocks and recepies   

  I'll appreciate every feedback and/or commit, a lot!
  You can download the Installer folder, and install it (windows) to try it out :)
  
## Controls:
	
	  W/A/S/D to move arround
	  Shift to sprint forwards
	  
	  Escape to get back to a menu / out of inventory
	  
	  E to open up your inventory
	  C to open the crafting grid
	
	
## Requirements:
	
    Chunk saving requires you to give full Read/Write Permissions 
    to the Saves folder (shortcut on desktop)
